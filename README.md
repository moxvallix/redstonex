RedstoneX is a datapack heavily inspired by Skyball's Redstone Expansion 2.0 (https://www.planetminecraft.com/data-pack/redexp2/).
This pack was made to act as an example project for what could be made with the datapack library, Redstone Interactions (https://www.planetminecraft.com/data-pack/redstone-interactions/)
This pack adds AND, NOT, OR and many other gates. This pack relies upon Redstone Interactions to be installed in order for it to function.

To get the configuration book, hold a redstone block in one hand and a book in the other. Stand above a block (list in book) and click "Get RedstoneX Block" to get one of the blocks.

Current features:
- Has all gates that were provided in Redstone Expansion 2.0
- Has the delayer as well
- Outputs to a repeater, and can take inputs from most sources. (See Redstone Interactions)


Future features:
- Planning on implementing some of the other features from Redstone Expansion 2.0.


Feel free to give any suggestions for future features, or extra blocks that could improve the datapack.
